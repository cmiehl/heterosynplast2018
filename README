For the probabilistic model in Figure 3A-C:

Figure 3A
Parameters are defined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.62;
ihet=0.62;

Figure 3B (upper panel)
Parameters are defined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.62;
ihet=0.62;

Figure 3B (lower panel)
Parameters are defined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.2;
ihet=0.2;

Figure 3C
Here the heterosynaptic decrease is changed systematically. The figure is generated for ehet=[0.98:0.02:0.02] and ihet=[0.98:-0.02:0.02] where the two values are the same in each simulation ehet=ihet. Note that the ratio in Fig. 3C is calculated by dividing the heterosynaptic weight decrease by the homosynaptic weight increase. So for example, when ehet=ihet=0.98, then the ratio of heterosynaptic (100%-98%=2%) to homosynaptic strength is 2%/65%=0.0308.
For different numbers of channels (e.g. 6), the parameter "channels" has to be changed accordingly.



For the biophysical model and Supplementary Figure 4:


Figure 3D-E
Parameters are as defined in the file "Biophysical_Model.m".

An instance of this code runs 1-2 hours on a MacBookPro (2014 model). 


Figure 3F
To titrate the learning rate ratio of heterosynaptic vs homosynaptic plasticity, the heterosynaptic learning rates are changed systematically. The figure is generated for eta_het_E=[0.1,2.5]*10^(-5) and eta_het_I=[0.1,2.5]*10^(-4). Note that both values are changed in the same way, if eta_het_E=0.1*10^(-5) then eta_het_E=0.1*10^(-4). The ratio of eta_het_E/eta_het_I=10^(-1) is always the same. To generate the full Fig. 3F requires writing an additional loop, which will require this code to be run a number of times (each 1-2 hours duration).

All other parameters are as defined in file "Biophysical_Model.m".
For different numbers of channels, the parameter "channels" has to be changed accordingly.
