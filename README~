This file lists all the parameter-values used for the biophysical model and the probabilistic model in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4.

Figure 3A
Parameters are predefined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.62;
ihet=0.62;

Figure 3B (upper panel)
Parameters are predefined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.62;
ihet=0.62;

Figure 3B (lower panel)
Parameters are predefined as:
channels=12;
eLT=1.65;
iLT=1.65;
ehet=0.2;
ihet=0.2;

Figure 3C
Here the heterosynaptic decrease is changed systematically. The figure is generated for ehet=[0.98:0.02:0.02] and ihet=[0.98:-0.02:0.02] where the two values are the same in each simulation ehet=ihet. Note that the ratio is Fig. 3C is calculated by the heterosynaptic weight decrease divided by the homosynaptic weight increase. 
For different numbers of channels, the parameter "channels" has to be changed accordingly.


Figure 3D-E
Parameters are as predefined in the file "Biophysical_Model.m".

Figure 3F
Here the heterosynaptic learning rates are changed systematically. The figure is generated for etha_het_E=[0.1,2.5]*10^(-5) and etha_het_I=[0.1,2.5]*10^(-4). Not that both values are changed in the same way, if etha_het_E=0.1*10^(-5) then etha_het_E=0.1*10^(-4). The prefactor is always the same, the ratio of etha_het_E/etha_het_I=10^(-1). All other parameters are as predefined in file "Biophysical_Model.m".
For different numbers of channels, the parameter "channels" has to be changed accordingly.
